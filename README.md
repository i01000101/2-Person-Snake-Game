# 2-Person-Snake-Game
It's a Snake game. It has classic mode and 1 vs 1 mode. Also there is some settings. There is 16 different game option in total.

The essential point of snake games is moving of snake. My snake class has an array list that keep JLabels for each part of snake. When snake is moving, snake's head goes to direction that user choose. Then each label goes to position of the label before itself.
